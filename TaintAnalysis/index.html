      <strong>Abstract: </strong>
       Dynamic <i>Taint</i> Analysis is a tool for checking security issue at
       runtime. As the web is becoming a central point for developing
       applications, developers are looking for ways to improve the security of
       their web pages.  As developer of the JavaScript engines, we need to find
       a solution for helping them while competing against other browsers.

        Hi,

        ###  Tainting == Flow  ###
        Tainting is an analysis made for following where the
        information is flowing the in a program.  This can be used to ensure
        that no private data are leaked, or that no foreign data can corrupt the
        state of a program.

        ###  Screenshot: Color == Origin  ###
        The Dynamic aspect of Taint analysis means
        that we do such analysis based on one run of the program.  In this
        screenshot (minemu.org), we can literally see the taint of the data
        based on their origins.

        ###  Dynamic? Fuzzing  ###
        Dynamic tainting is an interesting approach for web pages.
        This can be used to guards that data are not flowing in parts of the
        code where they are not supposed to flow into.  Combined with fuzzing
        approaches, this can find bugs in Web pages (or Firefox OS
        applications).

        </pre>
      <footer class="notes">
        This is a tiny example to highlight what tainting can do.

        In this example, we are reading the content of the password field, and
        call a page with the content of the input field.

        In such case, I guess the fact that I wrote 'password', is hurting you
        as being something bad, because we see that the password is leaking into
        a clear text channel.

        A tainting analysis should report such errors.

          <code>var hash = hasher(challenge, pwd);</code>
          <code>xhr("/msg/?hash=" + hash);</code>
        </pre>
      <footer class="notes">
        Ok, now it is fixed.  So we should not expect any messsage to be
        reported by the tainting.

        But, wait why would a tainting analysis stop reporting issues in such
        cases?  It should continue to report issues after all the password is
        used in the computation of the hash, in a similar way as it was used in
        the computation of the string which is given to XmlHttpRequest.  Or it
        might stop reporting if the taint is kept on a subset of the URL, in
        which case we can detect that the server will not look for any random
        page.

        What we see, is that in any cases these analysis need some
        instrumentation to taint data of primitive functions (DOM and JS) and
        warn about the tainting of some input.  And at last being able to
        customize this list to prevent false positives, such as this "hasher"
        function.

        So far, I saw 2 proposal made by different teams of implementations of
        dynamic taint analysis in SpiderMonkey.

        The first one is 'DOMinator', which started as a rewrite of Firefox 3.6
        and got recently updated by Ivan (which updated last year).

        The second one has no-name-yet, AFAIK.  And they do not want to go
        public before they make their publication.

        DOMinator, is only tainting the Strings, by reusing the bit fields that

        The problem of looking only at Strings, is that it is really easy to
        break out-side the scope of this analysis.  A simple example is
        JSON.parse, where we would expect to also taint the object.  A more
        recent example would be AsmJS code, as we are switching from ArrayBuffer
        to Strings.

        Also, if there is a tainting issue, it would have to be done in the
        JavaScript engine, where it is implemented.

        The second proposal is taking a turn compared to DOMintator, which is
        that they are tainting all Values.  To do so they needed some bits on
        the JSValueTag, so they boxed the double.

        I guess you all know what this means for Kraken and Octane benchmarks.

        code.

        We are the right person to ask when we are dealing with performances,
        but are we the right persons to decide about the correctness level that
        are acceptable?

        There is always trade-off between the execution time and the correctness
        of the analysis, don't we want to leave this choice to our users?

        So, can we do better?

        Before answering, I want to stop on a third approach.

        Jalangi is a dynamic analysis framework for JavaScript, this means that
        it is not limited to taint analysis.  In addition, of working on top of
        Chromium and Firefox (as an addon), they offer the ability to user to
        instrument their builds with custom analysis scripts.

        As this is a framework, they tried record-replay on Sunspider as well as
        5 webapp written for Tizen.

        <code>}</code>

      <pre class="right">

      </pre>
      <footer class="notes">
        Jalangi works by pre-processing the JavaScript code.  This means that
        they are rewriting a "+" to be a function call which takes both argument
        and the operator.

        This implies that they are emulating JavaScript semantics.  Emulating
        JavaScript is error prone.  So qualifying this framework to be an
        analysis framework is like adding a mental barrier to every analysis
        developers.

        Also, this add a non-neglectable performance overhead, as we have to
        make a function call in-place of '+' operator and loose all type
        information that we could have collected on the script.  Without
        mentionning that this Binary function would trivally become Megamorphic.

      </pre>
      <footer class="notes">
        When we are doing analysis, we are collecting informations about the
        script location, the values and so on.  Jalangi analysis has 2 things to
        do, first collecting information, such as the taint, then doing the
        emulation.

        The information collected about values is stored on a shadow object,
        which contains the information about the value, it is then 'unbox' for
        emulating the operation, and the result is 'boxed' with the taint
        information.

        Analyzed values are manipulated in the same compartment as the
        observer.  This might cause more correctness errors in the
        implementation of analysis.

      </ul>
      <footer class="notes">
        Jalangi has taken an interesting approach, and I think this is the best
        of all so far.  It removes the logic from the JS engine and leave it to
        persons who are specialized in their domain.

        But persons from another domain, such as security engineer for taint
        analysis, might not be JavaScript engine developers, and getting the
        semantics right is error prone.

        Also using a different parser implies that you are restricting your self
        to the common sub-set of both parsers (running w & w/o analysis).  And
        it is unlikely to support experimental features as SpiderMonkey might be
        doing.

        One of the thing suggested with Jalangi is that there is a
        non-neglectable overhead (> ~15x while recording on
        sunspider benchmark).  This can be understood as it is emulating the
        JavaScript with megamorphique functions called from every locations.

        Ok, let's come back to the previous example.

        In the previous example Jalangi was replacing the source by something
        else, adding another parser, emulating JavaScript and breaking type
        informations.

        What I suggests, is to avoid making an additional parser, by customizing
        the generated bytecode to monitor values.

        Note that instead of making a generic probe, we should make them
        specific.  One trivial example is monitoring the type of addition
        operands, where there is no need for checking the Substraction operator.

        Then instead of emulating the JavaScript semantics, we just observe
        values around the operation, and use a context to brace the
        operations.

        Also, having probes instead of an emulation, gives us the ability to run
        the Plus and PlusResult probe offline (asynchronously) as long as we
        keep the values around, thus keeping a minimal runtime overhead if
        wanted.

      <footer class="notes">
        By moving the probe to an analysis compartment, we remove all the boxing
        & unboxing overhead.  This becomes part of the API that all arguments
        are proxies over the content.

        This improve the analysis code as it does not have to emulate
        JavaScript.

Ideas:
 - We can add a JIT for almost-free, as opposed to today !
 - We can add a JIT to your project !

Slides:
 1. What is a Just-In-Time compiler
    a. Generate Machine code.
    b. Get better performance.
 2. Problems of the JITs.
    a. Specific to a language.
    b. Low level Assembly.
 3. HolyJit
    a. Language independent ! ( JIT Instrumented Rust code )
    b. JIT team does the dirty part, you select what to optimize.
 4. JIT opportunities are everywhere
    a. Loop
    b. Match
    c. Same / Similar inputs.
 5. I Need You !
    a. We can boost your performance.
    b. Increase the impact of the JIT team.

   - Improve Performance.
   - Library
     - Independent of the language.
     - Easy to instrument your code.

     - CSS
     - WebRender CPU backend.

Text: 5 minutes; 30 sec / pragraph.

 1. Firefox is shipped with a JIT compiler for almost 9 years. Since, we got 4
    JIT compilers (TraceMonkey, JaegerMonkey, IonMonkey and Baseline), and we
    have shipped IonMonkey for the last 5 years.

    SpiderMonkey is old and complex as well, and language feature such as
    lifetime are not going to justify a rewrite of SpiderMonkey in Rust.

 2. What we need to justify such effort is a carrot! In the case of the
    JavaScript engine, the carrot is named performance, or performance divided
    by the invesment time, which is known as impact. Can we get more performance
    with Rust, and how much effort would it be?

    The JIT and the GC are parts of the engine where we get the performance
    from? Can we provide a good solution for that?

 3. HolyJIT aims to simplify the way we write a JIT compiler in Rust. It works
    by dynamically intrumenting the Rust compiler, to do automatically the work
    that the JIT team as done by hand for the past 10 years based on the MIR
    representation of the Rust compiler, and annotations provided by the
    language implementers.

 4. HolyJit is a JIT for Rust. If we implement a JavaScript interpreter in Rust,
    and were to annotate to teach HolyJit what are the JIT entry points, what
    branches are inline caches, and how to deduce type information and guards,
    we could potentially produce the same code quality as what we have with
    IonMonkey and Baseline.

 5. This means that instead of writing hundreds of lines, we could only write a
    single and let HolyJit generate the hundred lines of code.

    When being fed to the Rust compiler, the artifact are still enough to be
    visible in terms of type and function names in the MIR.  The plugin look for
    these function and type names and rewrite the code to generate code, trace
    the code, or even optimize it ahead of time based on constness hypothesis.

 6. Ideally the final results should be identical to what we wrote by hand until
    now. If not, this means that either HolyJit is lacking optimizations, or we
    are lacking annotations to to teach how to handle these cases.

 7. This solution is great, it can dramatically reduce the amount of work needed
    to instrument the JavaScript engine, if it were written in Rust, but
    rewritting an engine, and a JIT compiler is too much efforts...

    This is where we need you!

 8. We can improve performances of any annotated interpreters implemented in
    Rust.

    By luck, we happen to already have some, one is the CSS rule matching engine
    of Stylo, which is already being shipped in Firefox. Another one is the CPU
    backend of WebRender, which basically interpreter for the display list
    applied for each pixel.

 9. Safari already got a JIT engines for CSS. They manage to get 2x speed-up out
    of it and they kept it.

    Google tried it, got the same speed-up, and stopped because it was too
    complex to maintain! Which is exactly what HolyJit is aimed for, which is
    reducing the maintenance effort needed to instrument an interpreter to get a
    JIT compiler.

10. Today, we have an opportunity, we can get twice the number of carrots, and
    bring us closer to the carrot field which is waiting for us.


last version:

1. Firefox is shipped with a JIT compiler for almost 9 years. Since, we
got 4 Just-in-time compilers and 3 Ahead of time compilers, and we have
shipped IonMonkey for the last 5 years.

SpiderMonkey is old and complex as well, and language feature such as
lifetime are not going to justify a rewrite of SpiderMonkey in Rust.

2. What we need to justify such effort is a carrot! In the case of the
JavaScript engine, the carrot is named performance, or performance
divided by the invesment time, which is known as impact. Can we get more
performance with Rust, and how much effort would it be?

The JIT and the GC are parts of the engine where we get the performance
from? What if we could write a GC and a JIT which could prove their
utility before we decide to commit to this rewrite?

3. In general, a JIT is specific to one language, and JIT libraries are
quite low level, and still require a large amount of work to integrate.

One exception to that are RPython and GraalVM. For the record, RPython
is inspired from the mistakes we did in TraceMonkey.

So, could we make a high-level JIT library for Rust?

4. HolyJIT is a high-level JIT library for Rust, which aims to be easy,
fast and secure.

It is simple because you do not have to generate code, you only
annotate your function to let a compiler plugin handle the annotated
functions and generate a JIT compiler for you.

This means that if we were to rewrite SpiderMonkey in Rust, we could use
this JIT library and annotate the code of the interpreter with the
proper annotation to get the same optimizations as we have done so far
by hand for the past 10 years.

5. HolyJIT works by instrumenting the Rust compiler with a plugin. This
plugin process the MIR at after all other optimizations have been
applied.

Macros, type and function calls are used as artifact remaining in the
code are detected by the plugin. When the plugin detects these
annotation, it will duplicate them, instrument them, and pre-compile
some of them ahead-of-time.

At the end, the generated binary might have the original uninstrumented
function for start-up performance, the equivalent of a Baseline compiler
and the equivalent of an optimizing compiler such as IonMonkey.

6. These annotations are used by the language developers to hint the JIT
library what parts should be optimized, and what hypothesis can be made,
such as the constness of some fields, guards, inline caches,
pre-conditions.

Ideally the final results should be identical to what we wrote by hand
until now. If not, this means that either HolyJit is lacking
optimizations, or we are lacking annotations to to teach how to handle
these cases.

7. Writing a JIT dedicated for SpiderMonkey is the same problem as
before, there is a lot of investment, we low returns, because our JITs
are currently too good.

A maintenance improvement is not worth the effort of developing a JIT to
compete with SpiderMonkey.

8 However, we could develop a JIT for the other parts of Firefox, which
could benefit from a JIT, such as the CSS selector matcher, or WebRender
CPU backend.

For example, Webkit has a JIT for CSS which reports a 2x
speed-up. Google tried and got the same speed-up but did not ship it
because the maintenance overhead.

HolyJIT aims at removing the maintenance overhead. Thus, by improving
the performance of CSS, we increase the impact of HolyJIT in Firefox,
and reduce the investment needed to motivate a rewrite of SpiderMonkey
in Rust.

9. Today, we have opportunities!

We can reduce the maintenance cost.
We can improve the security.
We can increase the impact of the JIT team.
We can improve performance futher than our competitors.
We can invest in this technology for a price cheaper than the
competition.

And let's not forget that at the end, SpiderMonkey would be rewritten in Rust.
